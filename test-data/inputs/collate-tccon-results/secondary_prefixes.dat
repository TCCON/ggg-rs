: This file defines prefixes to prepend to windows in the .Xsw files
: for different detectors. Each line gives a starting wavenumber,
: ending wavenumber, and an optional prefix. ALL windows must fall
: into one of the wavelength ranges defined in the rows below, if
: a range should not include a prefix, leave the third, fourth, and fifth
: columns empty. If a range should include a prefix, you must also provide
: a suffix and group to use in the netCDF file. By convention, netCDF group
: names should be in all caps. Also note that if you want the suffix
: separated from the variable name by a character (such as an underscore),
: said character must be included at the beginning of the suffix.
