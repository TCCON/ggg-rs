<p>GGG-RS is an extension to <a href="https://github.com/TCCON/GGG">the GGG retrieval</a> that provides updated version of several of the post-processing programs.
The long term intention is to also make this a library of functions useful for working with GGG-related files.</p>
<h2 id="installation"><a class="header" href="#installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>At present, installing GGG-RS requires that you be able to build it from source.
This requires, at a minimum, a <a href="https://rustup.rs/">Rust toolchain</a> installed.
If you wish to compile the programs that work with netCDF files, you will also need either</p>
<ul>
<li>one of the <code>micromamba</code>, <code>mamba</code>, or <code>conda</code> package managers, or</li>
<li>the <code>cmake</code> build tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are necessary to install or build the netCDF and HDF5 C libraries.
Detailed instructions and installation options are provided in the <a href="https://github.com/TCCON/ggg-rs">README</a>.</p>
<h2 id="documentation"><a class="header" href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>This book primarily focues on the command line programs provided by GGG-RS.
As the library is made available, the APIs will be documented through <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a> (for the Rust library) and <code>readthedocs.io</code> (for the Python library).</p>
<p>Each command line program will provide help when given the <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> flags.
That help should be your first resource to understand how the programs work, as it will be the most up-to-date.
The chapters in this book go into more detail about advanced usage of the programs.
If you find something in this book that is out of date or unclear, please <a href="https://github.com/TCCON/ggg-rs/issues">open an issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/TCCON/ggg-rs/pulls">pull request</a> with the <code>documentation</code> tag.</p>

<p>Post processing programs are used after completing GFIT runs on all windows.
These programs perform a combination of collating and averaging data from the different
windows and applying the necessary <em>post hoc</em> corrections to produce the best quality data.</p>
<p>We are currently in a transitional period, where the post processing programs are still
provided in a mix of languages.
Some remain the original Fortran versions from GGG2020, others have been replaces with Rust
versions, and the private netCDF writer remains written in Python.
The intention is to transition away from the Python netCDF writer in GGG2020.2,
but to retain a mix of Fortran and Rust programs at that time.
Whether all post processing programs transition to Rust depends on whether there is a need
for more flexibility in all programs.</p>
<h2 id="em27sun-users"><a class="header" href="#em27sun-users">EM27/SUN users</a></h2>
<p>Those who use GGG to process EM27/SUN data must be aware that EGI (the wrapper program to
streamline processing of EM27/SUN data with GGG) is <em>also</em> in a transitional phase.
The <a href="https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Main/EGI">original EGI</a> does not use GGG-RS programs,
and instead patches some of the existing GGG Fortran programs to work with EM27/SUN data,
as well as works around some limitations of the Fortran post processing code by swapping
out some of the configuration files on disk.
This works, but is inconvenient when you need to process both TCCON and EM27/SUN data.</p>
<p>A full rewrite of EGI, <a href="https://github.com/TCCON/egi-rs">EGI-RS</a> is in progress.
This is intended to be easier to maintain and modular, allowing smaller parts of the
GGG workflow to be run independently with EGI-RS automation as needed.
EGI-RS <em>does</em> use the programs provided by GGG-RS, and in fact relies on several of them
to simplify switching between TCCON and EM27/SUN configurations.
Throughout this section, the EM27/SUN standard use sections will be referring to the EGI-RS
use.
Those still using the original EGI should be aware that while the <em>role</em> of each program
in the EM27/SUN post processing is the same as its original Fortran predecessor, the
specifics of how it is run may differ.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="collate_tccon_results"><a class="header" href="#collate_tccon_results">collate_tccon_results</a></h1>
<h2 id="purpose"><a class="header" href="#purpose">Purpose</a></h2>
<p><code>collate_tccon_results</code> combines output from the various <code>.col</code> files in a GGG run directory with ancillary data from the runlog and <code>.ray</code> file into a single file.
It also computed retrieved quantities from the <code>.col</code> files if needed.
Which <code>.col</code> files are read is determined by a <code>multiggg.sh</code> file, which is expected to contain calls to <code>gfit</code> (one per line) for each window processed.
An example of a the first few lines of a <code>multiggg.sh</code> file is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">/home/user/ggg/bin/gfit luft_6146.pa_ggg_benchmark.ggg&gt;/dev/null
/home/user/ggg/bin/gfit hf_4038.pa_ggg_benchmark.ggg&gt;/dev/null
/home/user/ggg/bin/gfit h2o_4565.pa_ggg_benchmark.ggg&gt;/dev/null
/home/user/ggg/bin/gfit h2o_4570.pa_ggg_benchmark.ggg&gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike the standard <code>collate_results</code>, <code>collate_tccon_results</code> does not rely on the ZPD times of spectra to determine whether successive spectra in the runlog
(from different detectors) should have their outputs grouped into a single line in the output file.
Instead, it uses the spectrum names.</p>
<h2 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>The most common way to run this is from inside a GGG run directory (i.e., a directory containing the <code>multiggg.sh</code>, <code>.ggg</code>, <code>.mav</code>, and <code>.ray</code> files created by <code>gsetup</code>).
In that case, you will call it with a single positional argument, <code>v</code> to create a file containg vertical column densities or <code>t</code> to create one containing VMR scale factors.
The output file will have the same name as the runlog pointed to in the <code>.ggg</code> and <code>.col</code> files, with the extension <code>.vsw</code> or <code>.tsw</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$GGGPATH/bin/collate_tccon_results v
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to run this program from outside of a GGG run directory, you can use the <code>--multiggg-file</code> option to point to the <code>multiggg.sh</code> file to read windows from.
In this case, the output will be written to the same directory as the <code>multiggg.sh</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$GGGPATH/bin/collate_tccon_results --multiggg-file /data/ggg/xx20250101_20250301/multiggg.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This program relies on being able to determine a "primary" detector in order to know which spectra represent a new observation.
If you have a nonstandard setup that does not use "a" as the character in the spectrum name to represent the InGaAs detector, you can use
the <code>--primary-detector</code> option to specify a different character.
For example, if it should look for spectra with "g" as the detector indicator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$GGGPATH/bin/collate_tccon_results --primary-detector g v
</code></pre>
<h2 id="use-in-tccon-standard-processing"><a class="header" href="#use-in-tccon-standard-processing">Use in TCCON standard processing</a></h2>
<p>Most users will use this as part of running the <code>post_processing.sh</code> script to create the initial <code>.vsw</code> and <code>.tsw</code> files.
However, in any case, it will always be the first program run after GFIT as the other post processing programs need a post
processed file as input (i.e., they do not read from the <code>.col</code> files.)</p>
<h2 id="use-in-em27sun-standard-processing"><a class="header" href="#use-in-em27sun-standard-processing">Use in EM27/SUN standard processing</a></h2>
<p><code>collate_tccon_results</code> is used identically when processing EM27/SUN data as when processing TCCON data.
Unlike with the Fortran version of <code>collate_results</code>, it does not need adapted to account for the shorter time between successive observations.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="apply_tccon_airmass_correction"><a class="header" href="#apply_tccon_airmass_correction">apply_tccon_airmass_correction</a></h1>
<h2 id="purpose-1"><a class="header" href="#purpose-1">Purpose</a></h2>
<p><code>apply_tccon_airmass_correction</code> does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Converts gas column densities (in molecules per area) to column averages by dividing
by the O2 column and multiplying by the mean O2 atmospheric dry mole fraction.</li>
<li>Applies a solar zenith angle-dependent correction to those column averages that require
it, as defined by a configuration file.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can operate either on individual windows' column densities or on column densities calculated
by averaging together all the windows for a given gas.
The former is considered to be more accurate, as it allows for different airmass dependence per window
(which depends on the spectroscopy in that window), but the latter is preserved for backwards compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="examples-1"><a class="header" href="#examples-1">Examples</a></h2>
<p>This program requires two arguments: a path to a file defining the airmass corrections and
a path to either a <code>.vsw</code> file (created by <code>collate_tccon_results</code>) or <code>.vav</code> file (created
by <code>average_results</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$GGGPATH/bin/apply_tccon_airmass_correction CORRECTION_FILE VSW_OR_VAV_FILE
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>CORRECTION_FILE</code> will usually be one of those supplied with GGG, in the <code>$GGGPATH/tccon</code> subdirectory.
See <a href="postproc//postproc/corrections/airmass_correction_file.html">the configuration section</a> for the details of this
file's format if you need to modify one or create your own.</p>
<h2 id="use-in-tccon-standard-processing-1"><a class="header" href="#use-in-tccon-standard-processing-1">Use in TCCON standard processing</a></h2>
<p>For TCCON standard processing, the <code>CORRECTION_FILE</code> <em>must</em> be <code>$GGGPATH/tccon/corrections_airmass_preavg.dat</code>,
as these are the airmass correction factors derived for the required TCCON data version.
It must be run on the <code>vsw</code> file output by <code>collate_tccon_results</code>, as the TCCON standard processing uses per-window
airmass corrections.
This is automatically configured in the <code>post_processing.sh</code> file, therefore standard users should rely on the
<code>post_processing.sh</code> script to run the required post processing steps in the correct order.</p>
<h2 id="use-in-em27sun-standard-processing-1"><a class="header" href="#use-in-em27sun-standard-processing-1">Use in EM27/SUN standard processing</a></h2>
<p>As of GGG2020, EM27/SUNs still use per-gas airmass corrections, rather than per-window.
Therefore, this must be run on the <code>.vav</code> file output by <code>average_results</code> using the EM27/SUN-specific
airmass corrections included with EGI-RS.
If using EGI-RS correctly, it will automatically create a <code>post_processing.sh</code> file with the correct
post processing order for an EM27/SUN, so normal users should rely on that.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="airmass-correction-file-format"><a class="header" href="#airmass-correction-file-format">Airmass correction file format</a></h1>
<p>For backwards compatibility, this file is in the typical GGG input file format
of a line specifying the "shape" of the file, one or more header rows, then
tabular data.
These files come in two forms.
The first defines airmass corrections for each window, and includes not only
the magnitude of the correction, but two additional parameters that adjust the
form of the equation used for the correction.</p>
<h2 id="per-window-format"><a class="header" href="#per-window-format">Per-window format</a></h2>
<p>The GGG2020 TCCON standard file in this format is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">15 5

Contains airmass-dependent correction factors to be applied to the
column-averaged mole fractions. These are determined offline from the
symmetric component of the diurnal variation using derive_airmass_correction.
The ADCF_Err should be the 1-sigma standard deviations which represent day-to-
day variability. This vastly overestimates the uncertainty in the average
value, however the standard error underestimates the uncertainty.

The former (ADCF) is determined offline from the symmetric component

The ADCF_Err are the 1-sigma standard deviations which represent day-to-

The latter (AICF) is determined offline by comparisons with in situ profiles.
AICF_Err (uncertainties) are 1-sigma standard deviations from the best fit.

It must be run on the <code>.vav.ada</code> file output by <code>apply_tccon_airmass_correction</code>.
This is automatically configured in the <code>post_processing.sh</code> file, therefore standard users should rely on the

This file contains airmass-independent correction factors (AICFs) determined
offline by comparison against in situ data. CO2, wCO2, lCO2, CH4, and H2O use AICFs
determined as the weighted mean ratio of TCCON to in situ Xgas values. N2O
uses the ratio of TCCON to surface-derived in situ XN2O fit to a mid-tropospheric
potential temperature of 310 K, ensuring that it is fixed to the same temperature
as the ADCFs. CO, H2O, and Luft are not corrected.
For CO2, wCO2, lCO2, CH4, H2O, and CO the AICF_Err (uncertainties) are 2-sigma standard
deviations of bootstrapped mean ratios. For N2O, the error equals the fit vs. potential
temperature multiplied by twice the standard deviation of potential temperatures
experienced by the TCCON network.
The WMO_Scale column gives the WMO scale from the in situ data that the scale
factor ties to. There must be something in this column and must be quoted;
use "N/A" for gases with no WMO scaling. NB: although CO has no WMO scale (because it
is not scaled), the uncertainty was determined from the measurements on the WMO X2014A scale.

<p><code>write_public_netcdf</code> converts the private (a.k.a. engineering) netCDF files into smaller, more user-friendly, files distributed to most TCCON users.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>limiting the variables to the most useful,</li>
<li>removing <code>flag != 0</code> data,</li>
<li>limiting the data in the file based on the desired data latency, and</li>
<li>expanding the averaging kernels and prior profiles to be one-per-spectrum.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples-3"><a class="header" href="#examples-3">Examples</a></h2>
<p>The simplest use will convert the <code>PRIVATE_NC_FILE</code> into a public format file.
This assumes that the <code>PRIVATE_NC_FILE</code> filename begins with the two-character site ID for your site.
The public file will be in the same directory as the private file, and its name will reflect the site ID and the date range of the <code>flag == 0</code> data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$GGGPATH/bin/write_public_netcdf PRIVATE_NC_FILE
</code></pre>
<p>To avoid renaming the public file to match the dates of <code>flag == 0</code> data, use the <code>--no-rename-by-dates</code> flag.
This will replace "private" in the extension with "public", so if <code>PRIVATE_NC_FILE</code> was <code>pa_ggg_benchmark.private.qc.nc</code>, the public file would be named <code>pa_ggg_benchmark.public.qc.nc</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$GGGPATH/bin/write_public_netcdf --no-rename-by-dates PRIVATE_NC_FILE
</code></pre>
<p>Both of the above examples will use the standard TCCON configuration for which variables to copy.
To use the extended TCCON configuration (which will include gases from the secondary detector), add the <code>--extended</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$GGGPATH/bin/write_public_netcdf --extended PRIVATE_NC_FILE
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to customize which variables are copied, you must create your own configuration TOML file and pass it to the <code>--config</code> option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$GGGPATH/bin/write_public_netcdf --config CUSTOM_CONFIG.toml PRIVATE_NC_FILE

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="configuration"><a class="header" href="#configuration">Configuration</a></h1>
<p>The public netCDF writer must strike a balance between being strict enough to ensure that the required variable for standard TCCON usage are included in normal operation, but also be flexible enough to allow non-standard usage.
To enable more flexible use, the writer by default requires the standard TCCON variables be present, but can be configured to change the required variables.</p>
<p>The configuration file uses <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML format</a>.
The configuration file can be broadly broken down into five sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>auxiliary variables,</li>
<li>derived variables,</li>
<li>Xgas variable sets,</li>
<li>Xgas discovery, and</li>
<li>default settings.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="auxiliary-variables"><a class="header" href="#auxiliary-variables">Auxiliary variables</a></h1>
<p>Auxiliary variables are those which are not directly related to one of the target Xgases but which provide useful information about the observations. Common examples are time, latitude, longitude, solar zenith angle, etc.
These are defined in the <code>aux</code> section of the TOML file as an <a href="https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables">array of tables</a>.</p>
<p>The simplest way to define an auxiliary variable to copy is to give the name of the private variable in the netCDF file and what value to use as the long name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[aux]]
private_name = "solzen"
long_name = "solar zenith angle"
</code></pre>
<p>This will copy the variable <code>solzen</code> from the private netCDF file along with all its attributes <em>except</em> <code>standard_name</code> and <code>precision</code>, add the <code>long_name</code> attribute, and put the variable's data (subsetting to <code>flag == 0</code> data) into the public file as <code>solzen</code>.
Note that the <code>long_name</code> value should follow the <a href="https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#long-name">CF conventions meaning</a>.
We prefer <code>long_name</code> over <code>standard_name</code> because the <a href="https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html">available standard names</a> do not adequately describe remotely sensed quantities.</p>
<p>If instead you wanted to rename the variable in the public file, you can add the <code>public_name</code> field:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[aux]]
private_name = "solzen"
public_name = "solar_zenith_angle"
long_name = "solar zenith angle"
</code></pre>
<p>This would rename the variable to <code>solar_zenith_angle</code> in the public file, but otherwise behave identically to above.</p>
<p>You can also control the attributes copied through two more fields, <code>attr_overrides</code> and <code>attr_to_remove</code>.
<code>attr_overrides</code> is a TOML table of attibute names and values that will be added to the public variable.
If an attribute is listed in the private file with the same name as an override, the override value in the config takes precedence.
The latter is an array of attribute names to skip copying if present.
(If one of these attributes is not present in the private file, nothing happens.)
An example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[aux]]
private_name = "day"
long_name = "day of year"
attr_overrides = {units = "Julian day", description = "1-based day of year"}
attr_to_remove = ["vmin", "vmax"]
</code></pre>
<p>This will add or replace the attributes <code>units</code> and <code>description</code> in the public file with those given here, and ensure that the <code>vmin</code> and <code>vmax</code> attributes are not copied.
Take note, specifying <code>attr_to_remove</code> overrides the default list of <code>standard_name</code> and <code>precision</code>; this can be useful if you want to retain those (you can do so by specifying <code>attr_to_remove = []</code>), but if you want to exclude them, you must add them to your list.</p>
<p>Finally, by default any auxiliary variable listed here must be found in the private netCDF file, or the public writer stops with an error.
To change this behavior so that a variable is optional, add the <code>required = false</code> field to an aux variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[aux]]
private_name = "day"
long_name = "day of year"
required = false
</code></pre>
<p>Each auxiliary variable to copy will have its own <code>[[aux]]</code> section, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[aux]]
private_name = "time"
long_name = "zero path difference UTC time"

[[aux]]
private_name = "year"
long_name = "year"

[[aux]]
private_name = "day"
long_name = "day of year"
attr_overrides = {units = "Julian day", description = "1-based day of year"}

[[aux]]
private_name = "solzen"
long_name = "solar zenith angle"
</code></pre>
<p>By default, any of the standard TCCON auxiliary variables not listed will be added.
See the <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/defaults.html">Defaults</a> section for how to modify that behavior.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="computed-variables"><a class="header" href="#computed-variables">Computed variables</a></h1>
<p>Computed variables are similar to auxiliary variables in that they are not directly associated with a single Xgas.
Unlike auxiliary variables, these cannot be simply copied from the private netCDF file.
Instead, they must be computed from one or more private variables.
Because of that, there are a specific set of these variables pre-defined by the public writer.
Currently only one computed variable type exists, "prior_source".
You can specify it in the configuration as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[computed]]
type = "prior_source"
</code></pre>
<p>By default, this creates a public variable named "apriori_data_source".
You can change this with the <code>public_name</code> field, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[computed]]
type = "prior_source"
public_name = "geos_source_set"
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="xgas-discovery"><a class="header" href="#xgas-discovery">Xgas discovery</a></h1>
<p>Usually we do not want to specify every single Xgas to copy; instead, we want the writer to scan the private file to identify Xgases and copy everything that matches.
This both saves a lot of tedious typing in the configuration and minimizes the possibilty of copy-paste errors.</p>
<h2 id="rules"><a class="header" href="#rules">Rules</a></h2>
<p>The first part of the discovery section is a list of rules for how to find Xgas variables.
These come in two variants:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suffix rules: these look for variables that start with something starting with an Xgas-like pattern
and ending in the given suffix. The full regex is <code>^x([a-z][a-z0-9]*)_\w+_{suffix}$</code>, where <code>{suffix}</code> is the provided suffix.
Note that the suffix is passed through [<code>regex::escape</code>] to ensure that any special characters are escaped; it will only
be treated as a literal.</li>
<li>Regex rules: these allow you to specify a regular expression to match variables names. The regex <em>must</em> include a named
capture group with the name "gas" that extracts the physical gas abbreviation (i.e., the <code>gas</code> value in an <code>Xgas</code> entry).
This looks like <code>(?&lt;gas&gt;...)</code> where the <code>...</code> is the regular subexpression that matches that part of the string.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, the configuration will add a single regex rule that matches the pattern <code>^x(?&lt;gas&gt;[a-z][a-z0-9]*)$</code>.
You can disable this by setting <code>xgas_rules = false</code> in the <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/defaults.html"><code>[defaults]</code></a> section of the config.
This rule is designed to match basic Xgas variables, e.g., "xch4", "xn2o", etc.</p>
<p>The rules also include default settings for the prior profile, prior column average, averaging kernel (and its slant Xgas bins), and the traceability scale.
These can be specified the same way as described <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/explicit_xgases.html#ancillary-variable-specifications">in the Xgases ancillary subsection</a>,
and the defaults are the same as well.</p>
<p>An example of a regular expression rule that uses the default ways to infer its ancillary variables is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[discovery.rule]]
regex = '^column_average_(?&lt;gas&gt;\w+)$'
</code></pre>
<p>Two things to note are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The regular expression is inside single quotes; this is how TOML specifies literal strings and it the
most convenient way to write regexes that include backslashes. (Otherwise TOML itself will intepret them
as escape characters.)</li>
<li>The regex includes <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> to anchor the start and end of the pattern. In most cases, you will probably
want to do so as well to avoid matching arbitrary parts of variable names.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a suffix rule that also indicates that variables matching this rule should not include averaging kernels or the traceability scale is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[discovery.rule]]
suffix = "mir"
ak = { type = "omit" }
traceability_scale = { type = "omit" }
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the suffix rule contains a "suffix" key, while the regular expression rule has a "regex" key - this is how they are distinguished.
Also note that rules are checked in order, and a variable is added following the first rule that matches.
This means that if a variable matches multiple rules, then its ancillary variables will be set up following the first rule that matched.</p>
<h2 id="exclusions"><a class="header" href="#exclusions">Exclusions</a></h2>
<p>The second part of the discovery section are lists of gases or variables to exclude.
The first option is <code>excluded_xgas_variables</code>.
If a variable's private file name matches one of the names in that list, it will not be copied even if it matches one of the rules.
The other option is <code>excluded_gases</code>, which matches not the variable name, but the physical gas.
The easiest way to explain this is to consider the standard TCCON configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[discovery]
excluded_xgas_variables = ["xo2"]
excluded_gases = ["th2o", "fco2", "zco2"]
</code></pre>
<p><code>excluded_xgas_variables</code> specifically excludes the "xo2" variable; this would match the default regex rule meant to capture Xgases measured on the primary detector, but we don't want to include it because it is not useful for data users.
However, O2 measured on a silicon detector may be useful, so we do not want to exclude all O2 variables.
<code>excluded_gases</code> lists three gases that we want to exclude no matter what detector they are retrieved from.
"fco2" and "zco2" are diagnostic windows (for channelling and zero-level offset, respectively) and so will be included once for each detector.
"th2o" is temperature sensitive water, which is generally confusing for the average user, so we want to ensure that it is also excluded from every detector.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="explicitly-specified-xgases"><a class="header" href="#explicitly-specified-xgases">Explicitly specified Xgases</a></h1>
<p>This section allows you to list specific Xgas variables to copy, along with some or all of the ancillary variables needed to properly interpret them.
Usually, you will not specify each Xgas by hand, but instead will use the <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/xgas_discovery.html">discovery</a> capability of the writer to automatically find each Xgas to copy.
However, variables explicitly listed in this section take precedence over those found by the discovery rules.
This leads to two cases where you might specify an Xgas in this section:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Xgas does not follow the common naming convention, thus making it difficult to discover with simple rules, or difficult
to map from the Xgas variable to the ancillary variable.</li>
<li>The Xgas needs a different way to handle one of its ancillary variables that the default discovery does.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each Xgas has the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>xgas</code> (required): the variable name</li>
<li><code>gas</code> (required): the physical gas name, e.g., "co2" for all the various CO2 variables (regular, <code>wco2</code>, and <code>lco2</code>).
This is used to match up to, e.g., the priors which do not distinguish between the different spectra windows.</li>
<li><code>gas_long</code> (optional): the full name of the gas instead of its abbreviation, e.g. "carbon dioxide" for CO2. If not given,
then the configuration will try to find the <code>gas</code> value in its <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/gas_proper_names.html"><code>[gas_long_names]</code></a> section and use that,
falling back on the <code>gas</code> value if the gas is not defined in the gas long names section.</li>
<li><code>prior_profile</code> (optional): how to copy the a priori profile.</li>
<li><code>prior_xgas</code> (optional): how to copy the a priori column average.</li>
<li><code>ak</code> (optional): how to copy the averaging kernels.</li>
<li><code>slant_bin</code> (optional): how to find the slant Xgas bin variable needed to expand the AKs.</li>
<li><code>traceability_scale</code> (optional): how to find the variable containing the WMO or analogous scale for this data.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>prior_profile</code>, <code>prior_xgas</code>, <code>ak</code>, <code>slant_bin</code>, and <code>traceability_scale</code> can all be defined following the syntax in the <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf/explicit_xgases.html#ancillary-variable-specifications">ancillary variable specifications</a>.
Note that <code>slant_bin</code> is a special case in that it will only be used if the AKs are to be copied, but cannot be omitted in that case.</p>
<p>To illustrate the two main use cases for this section, here is an excerpt from the standard TCCON configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[xgas]]
xgas = "xluft"
gas = "luft"
gas_long = "dry air"
prior_profile = { type = "omit" }
prior_xgas = { type = "omit" }
ak = { type = "omit" }

[[xgas]]
xgas = "xco2_x2019"
gas = "co2"
prior_profile = { type = "specified_if_first", private_name = "prior_1co2", public_name = "prior_co2" }
prior_xgas = { type = "specified_if_first", private_name = "prior_xco2_x2019", public_name = "prior_xco2" }
ak = { type = "specified_if_first", private_name = "ak_xco2" }
slant_bin = { type = "specified", private_name = "ak_slant_xco2_bin" }

[[xgas]]
xgas = "xwco2_x2019"
gas = "co2"
prior_profile = { type = "specified_if_first", private_name = "prior_1co2", public_name = "prior_co2" }
prior_xgas = { type = "specified_if_first", private_name = "prior_xwco2_x2019", public_name = "prior_xco2" }
ak = { type = "specified_if_first", private_name = "ak_xwco2" }
slant_bin = { type = "specified", private_name = "ak_slant_xwco2_bin" }
</code></pre>
<p>First we have <code>xluft</code>.
This variable would be discovered by the <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/xgas_discovery.html#rules">default rule</a>; however, that rule will require prior information and AKs.
The prior information is not useful for Xluft, so we want to avoid copying that to reduce the number of extraneous variables, and there are no AKs for Xluft.
Thus we specify "omit" for each of these to tell the writer not to look for them.
We do not have to tell it to omit <code>slant_bin</code>, because omitting the AKs implicitly skips that, and <code>traceability_scale</code> can be left as normal because there is an "aicf_xluft_scale" variable in the private netCDF files.</p>
<p>Second we have <code>xco2_x2019</code> and <code>xwco2_x2019</code>.
(We have omitted the x2007 variables and <code>lco2_x2019</code> from the above example for brevity).
These would not be discovered by the <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/xgas_discovery.html#rules">default rule</a>.
Further, the mapping to their prior and AK variables is unique: all the CO2 Xgas variables can share the prior profiles and column averages, and each "flavor" of CO2 (regular, wCO2, or lCO2) can use the same AKs whether it is on the X2007 or X2019 scale.
Thus, we not only define that these variables need copied, but that we want to rename the prior variables to just "prior_co2" and "prior_xco2" and only copy these the first time we find them.
We also ensure that the AKs and slant bins point to the correct variables.</p>
<h2 id="ancillary-variable-specifications"><a class="header" href="#ancillary-variable-specifications">Ancillary variable specifications</a></h2>
<p>The ancillary variables (prior profile, prior Xgas, AK, slant bin, and traceability scale) can be defined as one of the following six types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>inferred</code>: indicates that this ancillary variable must be included and should not conflict with any other
variable. The private and public variable names will be inferred from the Xgas and gas names.</li>
<li><code>inferred_if_first</code>: similar to <code>inferred</code>, except that it is not an error if the variable already exists
in the public file. This is meant to support cases like described for CO2 above, where multiple Xgases share
a single ancillary variable - as long as one Xgas copies it, the other Xgases do not need to.
<strong>Note that the writer does not check that the existing variable's data are equal to what would be written for the new variable!</strong></li>
<li><code>opt_inferred_if_first</code>: similar to <code>inferred_if_first</code>, except that if the private variable does not exist,
then this variable will be skipped instead of causing an error. This is intended for <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/xgas_discovery.html#rules">Xgas discovery rules</a> more than explicit Xgas definitions.</li>
<li><code>specified</code>: allows you to specify exactly which variable to copy with the <code>private_name</code> field. You can also
give the <code>public_name</code> field to indicate what the variable name in the output file should be; if that is omitted,
then the public variable will have the same name as the private variable. It is an error if the public variable
already exists.</li>
<li><code>specified_if_first</code>: similar to <code>specified</code>, except that it is not an error if the public variable already exists.
(This is analogous to the relationship between <code>inferred</code> and <code>inferred_if_first</code>). This has the same <code>private_name</code>
and <code>public_name</code> fields as <code>specified</code>.</li>
<li><code>omit</code>: indicates that this variable should not be copied.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ancillary-variable-name-inference"><a class="header" href="#ancillary-variable-name-inference">Ancillary variable name inference</a></h2>
<p>The writer uses the following rules when asked to infer ancillary variable names.
In these, <code>{xgas_var}</code> indicates the Xgas variable name and <code>{gas}</code> the physical gas name.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>prior_profile</code>: looks for a private variable named <code>prior_1{gas}</code> and writes to a variable named <code>prior_{gas}</code>.</li>
<li><code>prior_xgas</code>: looks for a private variable named <code>prior_{xgas_var}</code> and writes to the same variable.</li>
<li><code>ak</code>: looks for a private variable named <code>ak_{xgas_var}</code> and writes to the same variable.</li>
<li><code>slant_bin</code>: looks for a private variable named <code>ak_slant_{xgas_var}_bin</code>. This is not written, it is only used to expand
the AKs to one-per-spectrum.</li>
<li><code>traceability_scale</code>: looks for a private variable named <code>aicf_{xgas_var}_scale</code>. The result is always written to the
<code>wmo_or_analogous_scale</code> attribute of the Xgas variable; that cannot be altered by this configuration.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="gas-proper-names"><a class="header" href="#gas-proper-names">Gas proper names</a></h1>
<p>Ideally, all Xgases should include their proper name in the <code>long_name</code> attribute, rather than just its abbreviation.
This section allows you to map the formula (e.g., "co2") to the proper name (e.g., "carbon dioxide"), e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[gas_long_names]
co2 = "carbon dioxide"
ch4 = "methane"
co = "carbon monoxide"
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the keys are the gases, not Xgases.
A default list is included if not turned off in the <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/defaults.html"><code>[Defaults]</code></a> section.
See the source code for <a href="https://github.com/TCCON/ggg-rs/blob/main/src/bin/write_public_netcdf/constants.rs"><code>DEFAULT_GAS_LONG_NAMES</code></a> for the current list.
You can override any of those without turning off the defaults; e.g., setting <code>h2o = "dihydrogen monoxide"</code> in this section will replace the default of "water".</p>
<p>Of course, when <a href="postproc/write_public_netcdf//write_public_netcdf/explicit_xgases.html">explicitly defining an Xgas to copy</a>, you can write in the proper name as the <code>gas_long</code> value.
The <code>[gas_long_names]</code> section is most useful for automatically discovered Xgases, but it can also be useful when defining multiple Xgas variables that refer to the same physical gas, as the <a href="https://github.com/TCCON/ggg-rs/blob/main/src/bin/write_public_netcdf/tccon_configs/standard.toml">standard TCCON configuration</a> does with CO2.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="defaults"><a class="header" href="#defaults">Defaults</a></h1>
<p>Unlike other sections, the <code>[defaults]</code> section does not define variables to copy; instead, it modifies how the other sections are filled in.
If this section is omitted, then each of the other sections will add reasonable default values if omitted.
The following boolean options are available to change that behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>disable_all</code>: setting this to <code>true</code> will ensure that no defaults are added in any section.</li>
<li><code>aux_vars</code>: setting this to <code>false</code> will prevent TCCON standard auxiliary variables from being added in the <code>aux</code> section.</li>
<li><code>gas_long_names</code>: setting this to <code>false</code> will prevent the standard mapping of chemical formulae to proper gas names being added to <code>[gas_long_names]</code>.</li>
<li><code>xgas_rules</code>: setting this to <code>false</code> will prevent the standard list of patterns to match when looking for Xgas variables from being added to <code>[discovery.rules]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="checking-on-xgas-discovery"><a class="header" href="#checking-on-xgas-discovery">Checking on Xgas discovery</a></h2>
<p>If variables are not being copied correctly, increase the verbosity of <code>write_public_netcdf</code> by adding <code>-v</code>
or <code>-vv</code> to the command line. The first will activate debug output, which includes a lot of information about
Xgas discovery. <code>-vv</code> will also activate trace-level logging, which will output even more information about the
configuration as the program read it.</p>
