    //  2. Get the list of available dimensions from these instances, and ensure there are no duplicates
    //  3. Get the list of required dimensions from these instances, write the dimensions required to the netCDF file
    //     (with their position determined by the `write_at_start` property)
    //  4. Get the unique groups required by all the data sources, if writing a hierarchical file, create those groups
    //  5. For each data source, loop through the groups it requires and pass it the `GroupMut` handle for that group
    //     (flat files will always get the root group, and append the required suffix to variable names).
