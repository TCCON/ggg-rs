# TODO: open an issue on the netCDF repo with the change suggested for add_variable_with_type:
# for some reason, the lifetime bounds are defined differently, which means passing a GroupMut
# into a function without lifetime bounds (`&'f mut netcdf::GroupMut<'g> where f': g'`) won't 
# work with add_variable_with type. Worse, putting those type bounds prevents using the group
# reference multiple times in a for loop.
